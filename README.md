# Clone of Zee5 Website

## Description

I've been learning since January 2022, as part of the Construct-week Project, I'm developing a clone of the Zee5 site utilising tech-stack HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Modern JavasScript.

ZEE5 is an Indian subscription video on-demand and over-the-top streaming service, run by Zee Entertainment Enterprises. Watch premieres of your favourite TV show episodes a day before telecast on ZEE5 & explore blockbuster movies, 100+ original content, music videos, live TV.

Several issues arose during my project, including carousel and mobile responsiveness, but I was able to accomplish my solo project with the support of Google and YouTube.

## The primary techstack I utilised to construct Front-End is listed below.

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript(ES6)

## Features

- Landing Page
- Login page
- Menu
- Search page with functionalities
- Show page
- Subscription page
